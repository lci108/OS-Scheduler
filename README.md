# OS Scheduler Implementation in C: FCFS, MLFQ, RR

This repository showcases my exploration into operating system scheduling algorithms through a C implementation. Featuring First-Come, First-Served (FCFS), Multilevel Feedback Queue (MLFQ), and Round-Robin (RR) algorithms, this project served as a platform for learning and experimentation.

## What I Learned

- Understanding the principles of process scheduling in operating systems.
- Implementing various scheduling algorithms to manage system resources effectively.
- Analyzing and comparing the performance of different scheduling strategies.
- Enhancing my proficiency in C programming and system-level concepts.
